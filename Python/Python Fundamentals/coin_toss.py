"""
You're going to create a program that simulates tossing a coin 5,000 times. Your program should display how many times the head/tail appears.

Sample output should be like the following:

          Starting the program...

Attempt #1: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 1 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far 
Attempt #2: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far 
Attempt #3: Throwing a coin... It's a tail! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far 
Attempt #4: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 3 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far
........
Attempt #5000: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2412 head(s) so far and 2588 tail(s) so far 

Ending the program, thank you!
